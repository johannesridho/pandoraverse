# Pandoraverse

Pandoraverse is a new parallel universe designed to explore restaurants through Augmented Reality. We can see the restaurants nearby, navigate to a specific restaurant, and see Foodpanda related marketing contents (such as vouchers, banners) placed in the real world through the Augmented Reality technology.
This app is built for Delivery Hero Hackathon 2021.

We built this iOS app based on https://github.com/DanijelHuis/HDAugmentedReality and the sample app from https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/environmental_analysis/placing_objects_and_handling_3d_interaction#overview.
